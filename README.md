# imageSegmentation
Basic image segmentation using openCV / skimage 


This is a simple approach to image segmentation without the need for creating a neural network. (We're using just some clever threshold tricks here instead). 

I'll do a semantic segmentation code in a following mini tutorial that will include a NN from Tensorflow.
